# leaflet-challenge
This challenge used Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.  The data markers reflected the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.  The popups provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked and a legend is also included with color coding.
